                <h4>Boy meets girl</h4>    
            </hgroup>

            <div class="half">

                <p>He was young, charming and great at crashing cars. She was stubborn, creative and excellent at eating ice cream, but in late 2005 they were on a collision course set for love. He bought her a lamp and she bought him some vests, however despite the crappy gifts they were soon shacked up together. The flat was in Canterbury; the furniture was Ikea.</p>

                <img id="snap1" src="content/young-couple.jpg"/> <img id="snap2" src="content/dj.jpg"/>

                <p>Canterbury was their home for two years, they lived a fun life - James spun his decks and Lou kept painting. They bought a cat called Austin who was amazing. They started thinking to the future and they wanted their own place, plus the Ikea furniture was falling apart. Next stop Mummy Begent’s house in Whitstable.</p>

                <img id="snap3" src="content/austin.jpg"/> <img id="snap4" src="content/nero-lily.jpg"/>


                <p>Poor Mummy Begent put up with the couple for a year whilst they worked hard and started to save their pennies. One day (12th Feb 2009), the couple went out for an evening and James asked if Lou would be his lobster...</p>

                <p>She said yes!</p>

                <img id="snap5" src="content/jim+lou.jpg"/> <img id="snap6" src="content/feet.jpg"/> 

                <p>Spurring their love on, they saved a bit more and with a helping hand they bought their little house in Faversham. They said goodbye to Whitstable and took their new cat Nero and to keep him company they got him a sister Lily. They settled in and fell in love with their little town and started to plan their wedding - let's hope it all goes well.</p>

                    <h4>Louise</h4>
                    <p>By day, Louise is a hard-working English teacher, by night, she's a snuggle wearing, ice-cream eating, shop-aholic. She's the most caring person I've ever met, and cares about animals so much that technically she should be a vegetarian. She's beautiful, intelligent, and supports me in everything I do. It's worrying how much I rely on her being there for me, I'm pretty sure that without her I would cease to exist... I better marry her quick!</p>

                    <h4>James</h4>
                    <p>James has many different nicknames to all that know him - Jim, Rambo, Squirrel (long story). But whichever name you know him as, I think everyone would agree what a great guy he is. Apart from appreciating his caring nature and unlimited creativity, he makes me laugh my head off! He is silly with the cats and makes up funny songs with me; I am very lucky to have him. If only he shared my love for cleaning (hey-ho, you can't win them all).</p>

                    <h4>Vanesa</h4>
                    <p>Louise met Vanessa five years ago in a facility known as CHS and they have been crazy teachers ever since. Vanessa will be the bride’s ‘wedding rock’, to keep her nerve-free on the day and tell her to ‘man up’. Vanessa is creative, intelligent and also: you do not want to mess with this woman!</p>

                    <h4>Emma</h4>
                    <p>Louise met Emma six years ago when they were both chirpy PGCE students and full of energy (how times have changed). Emma is totally sweet and this, coupled with a brilliant dry humour, makes her an excellent choice of bridesmaid. Emma loves to wear 'fancy dress' but was persuaded to wear a 'pretty dress' on the day!</p>

                    <p>Louise met Emily just days after she was born! Emily is cute as a button, has an obsession with Peppa Pig (like most 3 year-olds), and is way beyond her years (again, like most 3 year-olds). I am hoping that she will make it up the aisle without ditching any of her accessories, but whatever happens I am sure she will steal the show.</p>

                    <h4>Dan</h4>
                    <p>James and Dan have been friends since they were 6 years old. They grew up together and have always been interested in the same stuff. James was the bestman at Dan's wedding so it's only fair he returns the favour with the responsibility of the Bestman's speech. </p>

                    <h4>Matt</h4>
                    <p>Matt and James met 7 years ago when they worked together at Venture. They've kept in touch ever since and see each other regularly to go MTBing round the local woods. Matt and his family (wife and daughter) only live a few doors away - which is always handy when you run out of stuff.

                    <h4>Dean</h4>
                    <p>James has known Dean since Junior School. Dean's a bit of a Banker (a bank manager to be precise), so you'd expect him to be level-headed and sensible. He's not. After a couple of Jim Beams you never know what he's going to say/do next. He got married about 6 months ago, and still has the bank balance to prove it.</p>

                <h4>Dresscode</h4>

                <p><small>We want the whole day to be relaxed, so you don't have to come dressed to the nines. If the weather's nice we'll be spending most of the afternoon outside, so wear something cool and comfortable. Shorts and t-shirt are perfectly acceptable, as long as you have nice legs!</small></p>

                <p>After the ceremony, guests will have the opportunity to fill their tummies with some nibbles before we fire up the BBQ at about 6 o'clock. Evening celebrations will kick-off at 8pm with an eclectic mix of music and plenty of alcholic beverages.</p>

                <p>Our Honeymoon begins in Los Angels with a couple of days on the beach. Then we pick-up our Motor-home and spend just over 2 weeks touring California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona and New Mexico. All finished off with a couple of nights in Las Vegas.</p>

                <p>We don't get out much, so we'd really like to know if you have any travel tips, or can recommend any places to visit whilst we're out there.</p>
